//! This is the `augmented` crate, containing a single entry-point for the Augmented Audio Libraries.
//! Please see <https://github.com/yamadapc/augmented-audio> for more information.
//!
//! ## Overview
//! `augmented` exports utilities and audio processors aimed at making it easier to build audio
//! applications with rust from a common foundation.
//!
//! These utilities are experimental and built on spare time by one person who isn't an audio
//! developer. [Therefore, your feedback is greatly appreciated](https://github.com/yamadapc/augmented-audio/issues/new).
//!
//! `augmented` is modular and all components exist in several small crates you can cherry-pick.
//!
//! ## Core concepts
//! Some concepts are shared between all the crates, for example, the [`audio::processor::AudioProcessor`] and
//! [`audio::processor::SimpleAudioProcessor`] traits are how all audio nodes should be
//! implemented.
//!
//! Here's an example gain node:
//! ```
//! use augmented::audio::processor::SimpleAudioProcessor;
//! struct ExampleGainProcessor {}
//! impl SimpleAudioProcessor for ExampleGainProcessor {
//!     type SampleType = f32;
//!     fn s_process(&mut self, sample: Self::SampleType) -> Self::SampleType {
//!         sample * 0.2
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The two traits are two different ways of defining an [`audio::processor::AudioProcessor`].
//! The [`audio::processor::SimpleAudioProcessor`] is a sample-by-sample (or frame by frame)
//! processor function, while [`audio::processor::AudioProcessor`] receives one
//! [`audio::processor::AudioBuffer`] at a time.
//!
//! The processors must implement a `prepare` (or `s_prepare`) method, which receives
//! [`audio::processor::AudioProcessorSettings`] to configure things like channel count or
//! sample-rate.
//!
//! They must also implement `process`, `s_process` or `s_process_frame` method to process samples.
//!
//! For "simple processors", which are defined as sample-by-sample functions, the
//! [`audio_processor_traits::simple_processor::process_buffer`] and [`audio_processor_traits::BufferProcessor`]
//! handle conversion into a regular buffer processor.
//!
//! Once an audio-processor is implemented, it can use [`application::audio_processor_standalone`] to
//! create a CLI or VST app automatically.
//!
//! This processor can also be a node in an [`audio::processor::graph`].
//!
//! ## Memory management model
//! The crates rely on reference counted pointers to state that is shared between the audio-thread
//! and other threads. This is done with `basedrop::Shared`.
//!
//! The idea is shared state is behind `basedrop::Shared` pointers which are never dropped on the
//! audio-thread. Instead, their destructors are pushed onto a queue and a background thread handles
//! dropping these values.
//!
//! This background thread is managed through [`audio::gc`]. That is a global instance of this
//! system, which exports helpers such as [`audio::gc::make_shared`] to build smart pointers that will
//! be de-allocated by the global background thread.

/// [`vst`] is re-exported for convenience.
pub use vst;

/// Run [`audio::processor::AudioProcessor`]s and [`audio::processor::midi::MidiEventHandler`] as
/// stand-alone applications.
pub mod application;
/// Process audio and MIDI information by defining [`audio::processor::AudioProcessor`]s, using
/// [`audio::processor::utility`] built-in processors or building [`audio::processor::graph`]s. Handle
/// real-time shared memory through ref-counting with [`audio::gc`].
