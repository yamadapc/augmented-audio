# audio-processor-analysis

Provides implementations of some audio analysis processors.

* **RMS**
* **Peak detector**
* **FFT (Windowed/Overlapped)**
* **Transient detection** (not real-time)
* **Window functions**

## RMS
Real-time safe, per-sample (ticked by UI thread) RMS calculation.

## Peak detector
Peak detector with adjustable attack/release times.

## FFT
`rustfft` audio-processor, forwards or backwards, real-time safe, FFT.

Applies a Hann window.

Then performs FFT with N bins.

Overlap is configurable

## Transient detection

Implements "[A Transient Detection Algorithm for Audio Using Iterative Analysis of STFT.

Does polyphonic transient detection, able to output signal or markers

## Window functions
Several window functions are implemented and configurable.
