//! Provides implementations of some audio analysis processors.
//!
//! * **Peak detector** - [`peak_detector`]
//! * **FFT (Windowed/Overlapped)** - [`fft_processor`]
//! * **Transient detection** (not real-time) - [`transient_detection::stft`]
//! * **Window functions** - [`window_functions`]
//!
//! ## RMS
//! Real-time safe, per-sample (ticked by UI thread) RMS calculation.
//!
//! ## Peak detector
//! Peak detector with adjustable attack/release times.
//!
//! ## FFT
//! `rustfft` audio-processor, forwards or backwards, real-time safe, FFT.
//!
//! Applies a Hann window by default. Several window functions are exported by [`window_functions`].
//!
//! ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yamadapc/augmented-audio/master/crates/augmented/audio/audio-processor-analysis/src/window_functions/windows--HannWindow.png)
//!
//! Then performs FFT with N bins.
//!
//! ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yamadapc/augmented-audio/master/crates/augmented/audio/audio-processor-analysis/src/fft_processor.png--FFT_sine_440Hz.png)
//!
//! Overlap is configurable
//!
//! ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yamadapc/augmented-audio/master/crates/augmented/audio/audio-processor-analysis/screen.png)
//!
//! ## Envelope follower
//!
//! Envelope follower implementation with adjustable attack/release times.
//!
//! ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yamadapc/augmented-audio/master/crates/augmented/audio/audio-processor-analysis/audio-envelope.png)
//!
//! ## Transient detection
//!
//! Implements "[A Transient Detection Algorithm for Audio Using Iterative Analysis of STFT.](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Balaji-Thoshkahna/publication/220723752_A_Transient_Detection_Algorithm_for_Audio_Using_Iterative_Analysis_of_STFT/links/0deec52e6331412aed000000/A-Transient-Detection-Algorithm-for-Audio-Using-Iterative-Analysis-of-STFT.pdf)".
//!
//! Does polyphonic transient detection, able to output signal or markers
//!
//! ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yamadapc/augmented-audio/master/crates/augmented/audio/audio-processor-analysis/src/transient_detection/stft.png)
//!
//! ## Window functions
//! Several window functions are implemented and configurable.
