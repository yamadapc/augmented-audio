Traits for audio processor types and audio buffer types. Heavily subject to change.

## Primer
This is very much exploration based, and I'm still finding out the best API to express in Rust types.

I think I've found a good abstraction to handle **AudioBuffer** and basic FX **AudioProcessor**, but there's quite a
lot more to uncover.

## Motivation
It'd be great to have generic traits for structs that process audio.

These may be 1 or more abstractions on top of audio processing which enable higher-level systems to manipulate audio
processing nodes.

At its core, audio processing may be defined as a function:
```rust
fn process_audio(_input: &mut [f32]) { /* ... */ }
```

`input` would be your input/output buffer, and you could perform mutable operations on it. However, this does not
encode several audio processing concerns, such as:

* The buffer won't be always `f32`, it might be `f64`
* The buffer channel count isn't expressed
* The buffer layout for multichannel data isn't expressed (e.g. Interleaved data or otherwise)
* Sample rate isn't expressed
* Dry/wet configurations aren't expressed
* MIDI & other concerns aren't expressed

We'd like some abstraction that covers some of these issues. Without thinking about external system problems (such as
MIDI, state & dry/wet), a basic audio processor trait can solve buffer/sample conversion issues.

## AudioBuffer
An `AudioBuffer` trait is provided. It provides an abstraction to get the size of the buffer and modify it.

The `AudioBuffer` trait may wrap samples in different layouts or with different ownership, however, it's recommended to
process samples using the `AudioBuffer::frame`, `AudioBuffer::frame_mut`, `AudioBuffer::slice` and
`AudioBuffer::slice_mut`.

The reason for this is that using `slice` iterators is much more efficient than iterating over a range of numbers and
calling `AudioBuffer::get`.

It's very unfortunate, but there's not a uniform optimised way to iterate between buffers that have different layouts
provided in this crate yet.

Something I think should work is to have some kind of channel iterator which will wrap the slice iterators. The channel
count should be low so losing some optimisation when reading a frame shouldn't be an issue.

Note that 10-20x slowdown is based on a very trivial "gain" work-load. In practice this might be an issue.

On my computer, there's around 600ns overhead per 512 samples to use the `get/set` functions.

With the `_unchecked` versions which skip bounds checking, the overhead is around `300ns` and with `frames`/`slice`
there's no overhead.

In comparison, my current implementation of interleaved to VST buffer conversion takes around 1.15us to convert from
CPAL into VST and 1.1us to convert out of VST back to CPAL.

That'd be roughly 2us spent on conversions per 512 sample block, vs a 300-600ns slowdown from iteration.

This has made me think is that it might be better that `AudioProcessor`s only expose a
`process_sample(&mut self, sample: f32)` function so that they are really not connected to the `AudioBuffer` at all.

## AudioProcessor

The **AudioProcessor** trait is only two methods:

```rust
pub trait AudioProcessor {
    type SampleType;
    fn prepare(&mut self, _settings: AudioProcessorSettings) {}
    fn process<BufferType: AudioBuffer<SampleType = Self::SampleType>>(
        &mut self,
        data: &mut BufferType,
    );
}
```

It provides a prepare callback, where channel & sample rate configuration will be provided and a process callback where
a generic `AudioBuffer` is provided.

### Design notes
#### SampleType associated type

The `SampleType` is provided as an associated type to both the `AudioBuffer` and the `AudioProcessor` traits. This
enables implementors to use generic `SampleType` types in their processors.

For example, this is the `SilenceAudioProcessor` implementation in this crate, which should work for any `num::Float`
type and any `AudioBuffer` implementation:

```rust
pub struct SilenceAudioProcessor<SampleType>(PhantomData<SampleType>);

impl<SampleType: num::Float + Send> AudioProcessor for SilenceAudioProcessor<SampleType> {
    type SampleType = SampleType;

    fn process<BufferType: AudioBuffer<SampleType = Self::SampleType>>(
        &mut self,
        output: &mut BufferType,
    ) {
        for sample_index in 0..output.num_samples() {
            for channel_index in 0..output.num_channels() {
                output.set(
                    channel_index,
                    sample_index,
                    <BufferType as AudioBuffer>::SampleType::zero(),
                );
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Pending work
* ~~MIDI trait~~
* Richer API for applications
* State management guidelines, using a background ref-counting garbage-collector & immutable 'state handle' references
  (while still allowing the internal state of a processor to be mutable)
* Automatic implementation of the VST API for all trait implementors
* Automatic implementation of the LV2 API for all trait implementors
* Automatic implementation of a "stand-alone" `cpal` based App for all trait implementors (see
  `audio-processor-standalone` in this repository)
* An audio-graph implementation
* GUI support
* Testing tools

## Buffer performance
On a trivial gain benchmark, performance using the `AudioBuffer::get` APIs is between 10-20x worse on a 
`VecAudioBuffer` than a `Vec`.

Other things to measure:

* Measure buffer conversion time on a small window size
  * Compare this with overhead of the `AudioBuffer` abstraction
* Measure overhead in contrast to the grand scheme of a non-trivial processor (not gain)

### Other thoughts
* Which is the more efficient layout?
* Should audio-processors expose a `process` function that works sample by sample? Perhaps this is easier to optimise
